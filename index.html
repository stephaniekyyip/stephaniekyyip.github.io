			<h1>My Interests</h1>
			<p>The area that fascinates me the most is the integration of hardware and software.
			I enjoy working on projects that more or less combine the two fields I studied in
			college– electrical engineering and computer science. Although, lately, I have also been having fun
			learning more about software. </p>


			<h1>About This Website</h1>
			<p>I have spent the past decade trying to learn HTML
			and CSS to create my own themes on various websites, starting with Neopets
			in elementary school. Now that I have more free time and experience in
			computer science, I decided to buckle down and finally understand how this
			all works. I acknowledge that I know practically nothing about web
			development, but I am enjoying the process of learning. </p>
