		<div class = "mainContent">
			<h3>Hello!</h3>
			<p class = "insideText"> I am Stephanie Yip, a recently graduate with a B.S. in 
			Electrical and Computer Engineering. My areas of interest include aerospace, 
			embedded devices, and internet of things. Namely, I like the integration of 
			hardware and software. My goal is to work on something that more or less 
			combines the two fields I studied in college– electrical engineering and 
			computer science. I’m not entirely sure what that opportunity looks like, but in the 
			meantime, I enjoy learning more about software. </p>
			
			<p class = "insideText">I decided to create a website as a side project, 
			and this is the result. Here is my engineering portfolio that shows my 
			experiences and projects. I have also included my photography for fun.</p>
