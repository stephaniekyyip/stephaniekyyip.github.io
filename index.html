			<h3>My Interests</h3>
			<p class = "insideText">The area that fascinates me the most is the 
			integration of hardware and software. My goal is to work on something 
			that more or less combines the two fields I studied in college– electrical 
			engineering and computer science. I’m not entirely sure what that opportunity 
			looks like, but in the meantime, I enjoy learning more about software.
			</p>
			<h3>About This Website</h3>
			<p class = "insideText"> I have spent the past decade trying to learn HTML 
			and CSS to create my own themes on various websites, starting with Neopets 
			in elementary school. Now that I have more free time and experience in 
			computer science, I decided to buckle down and finally understand how this 
			all works. I acknowledge that I know practically nothing about web 
			development, but I’m having fun trying anyway.
