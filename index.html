			<h1>My Interests</h1>
			<p>The area that fascinates me the most is the 
			integration of hardware and software. I hope to have the pleasure of working on 
			something that combines the two fields I studied in college– electrical 
			engineering and computer science. I’m not entirely sure what that opportunity 
			looks like, but in the meantime, I enjoy learning more about software.</p>
			
			
			<h1>About This Website</h1>
			<p>I have spent the past decade trying to learn HTML 
			and CSS to create my own themes on various websites, starting with Neopets 
			in elementary school. Now that I have more free time and experience in 
			computer science, I decided to buckle down and finally understand how this 
			all works. I acknowledge that I know practically nothing about web 
			development, but I’m having fun trying anyway.</p>
