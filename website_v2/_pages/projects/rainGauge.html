<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  For my senior design project, I worked in an interdisciplinary team comprised
  of both environmental science students and electrical and computer
  engineering students, including myself. The project's sponsor,
  <a href = "http://www.glacierpeakinstitute.org/">Glacier Peak Institute</a>
  tasked our team with creating an environmental sensor curriculum for middle
  school students in Darrington, WA.
</p>
<p>
  The project's requirements were that the curriculum had to be low-cost, fun
  and interesting for the kids, relevant to the local environment of Darrington, and allowed
  the kids to enjoy the outdoors. As a result, our team decided to create an electronic rain
  gauge curriculum.
</p>

<h1>How the Rain Gauge Works</h1>
<p>
  The physical design of the rain gauge involves a funnel attached to a PVC pipe
  with a pressure sensor attached to the bottom. The rainwater would be collected
  in the PVC pipe, where the pressure sensor can measure the pressue due
  to both the atmosphere and rainwater.
</p>
<p>
  A second pressure sensor is used to measure the atmospheric pressure. Together,
  the two pressure sensors can find the differential pressure, as
  in the pressure due to only the rainwater. This differential pressure can be used
  to find the depth of the rainwater contained in the PVC pipe.
</p>
<p>
  The electronics are connected to an ESP8266 microcontroller that is programmed
  using the Arduino IDE. The code used for the rain gauge logs the differential
  pressure reading and the current time measured by the real time clock (RTC) onto
  a micro SD card every 15 minutes.
</p>
<p>
  The idea is that the rain gauge can be set
  outside to automatically collect rain data with minimal maintenance, which includes
  retrieving the SD card to collect the data and changing the batteries.
</p>

<h1>What I Did</h1>
<p>
  I interfaced the electronic components with the ESP8266 microcontroller using
  SPI and I2C. Using the Arduino IDE, I wrote code to control and get data from
  the components. I also worked on the construction of the rain gauge, including
  the wiring of the components on the breadboard and the design of the waterproof housing
  for pressure sensor.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to working on the hardware and software, I had a leadership role
  in the project, in which I led team meetings and faciliated communication between
  our faculty advisors and project sponsor on behalf of our team.
