<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  For the final project in our Internet of Things course, my team decided to
  create a smart light system to allow the user to remotely control a LED bulb.
  The idea behind the smart light was to conserve energy by automatically
  adjusting the brightness of the LED depending on the ambient light in the room.
</p>

<h1>How the Smart Light Works</h1>
<p>
  We interfaced the LED bulb, along with a photo-resistor and a transistor, with
  a Raspberry Pi. The photo-resistor was used to determine the ambient brightness
  in the room to allow us to adjust the brightness of the LED accordingly. The
  transistor was used with the battery pack to allow us to vary the brightness
  of the LED using the pulse width modulation (PWM) output from the Raspberry Pi.
</p>

<h1>What I Did</h1>
<p>
  In order to control the LED, I wrote Python scripts to adjust the LED brightness
  by varying the PWM output. I also wrote a Python script to read the input from the photoresistor
  to allow the option of automatically adjusting the brightness of the LED according
  to the ambient brightness.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to using Python, I used PHP with the Apache server on the Raspberry
  Pi to retrieve the user's input from the webpage and execute the appropriate Python
  scripts.
