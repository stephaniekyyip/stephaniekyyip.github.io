  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>
  I graduated from Seattle University in 2017 with a B.S. in Electrical and
  Computer Engineering. My work experience is mainly in the aerospace industry
  as a software engineer.
  </p>

  <p>
  The area that fascinates me the most is the integration
  of hardware and software. I'm especially interested in projects that involve software
  interacting with the physical world, such as in embedded devices and internet of things.
  Lately, I've been working on side projects to learn more about full stack web development.
  </p>

  <!-- <p>
  Although I have worked with hardware and circuits, I prefer working on
  the software side of things. I have mostly used C and C++ in low-level/
  embedded software, but I have been making an effort recently to
  learn other programming languages and learn about other areas of software
  engineering.
  </p> -->

  <p>I loved studying computer engineering, but my interests are not
  limited to only my work and college experiences. I enjoy all things software and tech-related and am
  eagar to learn more!
