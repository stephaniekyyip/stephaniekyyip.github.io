           <h3>Overview</h3>
           <p>As a part of my year-long senior project, I worked in an
             interdisciplinary team comprised of environmental science
             and electrical/ computer engineering students. Our sponsor,
             Glacier Peak Institute, tasked us with creating
             an environmental sensor curriculum for middle school students in Darrington, WA.
             The requirements were that the curriculum had to be low-cost,
             fun and interesting for the kids, and involve the
             outdoors. We decided to create an electronic rain gauge curriculum
             due to the high levels of rainfall in Darrington and our faculty
             advisor's prior experience in constructing a rain gauge.
           </p>

           <h3>How the Rain Gauge Works</h3>
           <p>The physical design of the rain gauge involved a funnel attached to a PVC pipe
             that allowed water to be collected in the PVC. At the bottom of the
             PVC pipe was a pressure sensor used to find the pressure of the
             rainwater, which was encased in a waterproofed container. Wires
             from the pressure sensor were threaded through a waterproof box
             to connect to the breadboard inside that contains the rest of the
             electronic components. The second pressure sensor on the breadboard
             is used to find the atmospheric pressure.</p>
            <p>The two pressure sensors are used to find a differential pressure,
              which can be used to to find the depth of rainwater collected in a
              PVC tube after calibration. This pressure measurement, along with
              the current time measured by the Real Time Clock (RTC), was logged
              onto a micro SD card at a set interval of 15 minutes. The idea is
              that the rain gauge can be set outside to automatically collect
              rain data with minimal maintenance, which includes retrieving the
              SD card to collect the data and changing the batteries.</p>

           <h3>My Role within the Project</h3>
           <p>I interfaced various electronic components with the
             microcontroller using SPI and I2C and
             wrote Arduino code to control the components.
             I worked on the construction of the rain gauge and designed the
             waterproof housing for the pressure sensors. Additionally, I played a
             leadership role in the project by organizing meetings and
             communicating with the facuty advisors and project sponsor on behalf of the team.</p>

           <h3>Overview</h3>
           <p>For the final project in our Internet of Things course, my team
             decided to create a smart light system to remotely control a LED
             bulb. The idea behind the smart light was to conserve energy by
             being able to remotely turn off lights and adjust the brightness
             depending on the ambient light.</p>

           <h3>How the Smart Light Works</h3>
           <p>We interfaced the LED bulb, along with a photoresistor and a
             transistor, with a Raspberry Pi. The photoresistor was used to
             determine the ambient brightness of the room in order to adjust
             the LED brightness accordingly. The transistor used with the
             battery pack allowed us to vary the brightness of the LED using
             the pulse width modulation (PWM) output from the Raspberry Pi. </p>

           <h3>My Role within the Project</h3>
           <p>I was responsible for the software side of the project. In order
             to control the LED, I wrote Python scripts to adjust the LED
             brightness by varying the PWM output. I also wrote a Python script
             to read the input from the photoresistor to allow the option of
             automatically adjusting the brightness depending on the ambient
             light in the room. After setting up an Apache server on the Raspberry
             Pi, I created the user interface using HTML for users to select
             different LED settings and used PHP to retrieve the user input in
             order to execute the Python scripts. </p>

           <figcaption>Demo of puppet movements.</figcaption>

           <h3>Overview</h3>
           <p>As a part of my electrical engineering labs during junior year, I
             worked with a lab partner to implement a marionette puppet that
             performed a dance routine on command. The idea behind the project
             was to become familiar with lab equipment and to develop engineering
             troubleshooting and teamwork skills by working towards a project
             throughout the school year. </p>

            <h3>How the Puppet Works</h3>
            <p>The puppet’s movements were controlled by various circuits and
              programmed in C using a Raspberry Pi. A motor and a connected
              optical encoder allowed for the control of the puppet’s limbs,
              which included moving each limb up or down by a designated distance. </p>

            <h3>My Role in the Project</h3>
            <p>Though the lab instructors had done the final design for both the
              hardware and software, my lab partner and I were responsible for the construction,
              testing, and troubleshooting of the puppet. We had to read circuit
              schematics, build and test the circuits and hardware, modify C code
              to control the puppet’s dance moves, and integrate and troubleshoot
              both the software and hardware. I focused mainly on the software
              side of the project amd worked together with my partner on other areas
              of the project, particularly the troubleshooting and testing aspects.</p>
