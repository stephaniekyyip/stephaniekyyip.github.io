  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>
    For my senior design project, I worked in an interdisciplinary team that included
    both environmental science students and electrical and computer
    engineering students. The project's sponsor,
    <a href = "http://www.glacierpeakinstitute.org/">Glacier Peak Institute</a>,
    tasked our team with creating an environmental sensor curriculum for middle
    school students in Darrington, WA.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project's requirements were that the curriculum had to be low-cost, fun
    and interesting for the kids, relevant to the local environment of Darrington, and allowed
    the kids to enjoy the outdoors. As a result, our team decided to create an electronic rain
    gauge curriculum.
  </p>
  
  <h1>How the Rain Gauge Works</h1>
  <p>
    The physical design of the rain gauge involves a funnel attached to a PVC pipe
    with a pressure sensor attached to the bottom. The rainwater would be collected
    in the PVC pipe, where the pressure sensor can measure the pressue due
    to both the atmosphere and rainwater.
  </p>
  <p>
    A second pressure sensor is used to measure only the atmospheric pressure. Together,
    the two pressure sensors can be used to find the differential pressure, as
    in the pressure due to only the rainwater. After calibration, this differential pressure can be used
    to calculate the depth of the rainwater contained in the PVC pipe.
  </p>
  <p>
    The electronics are connected to an ESP8266 microcontroller that is programmed
    using the Arduino IDE. The code used for the rain gauge logs the differential
    pressure reading and the current time measured by the real time clock onto
    a micro-SD card every 15 minutes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The idea is that the rain gauge can be set
    outside to automatically collect rain data with minimal maintenance, which includes
    retrieving the SD card to collect the data and changing the batteries. In contrast, a 
    traditional rain gauge would require the user to manually measure the amount of rainwater through a graduated
    cylinder and would be limited to how often the user is available to take the measurements, which may
    not be possible in the middle of a heavy downpour.
  </p>
  
  <h1>What I Did</h1>
  <p>
    I interfaced the electronic components with the ESP8266 microcontroller using
    SPI and I2C. Using the Arduino IDE, I wrote code to control and get data from
    the components. I also worked on the construction of the rain gauge, including
    the wiring of the components on the breadboard and the design of the waterproof housing
    for pressure sensor.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In addition to working on the hardware and software, I held a leadership role
    in the project, in which I led team meetings and coordinated communication between
    our faculty advisors and project sponsor on behalf of our team.
