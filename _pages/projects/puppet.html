<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  As a part of my junior year electrical and computer engineering labs,
  I worked with a lab partner to implement a marionette puppet that performed
  a dance routine on command.
</p>

<h1>How the Puppet Works</h1>
<p>
  The puppet's movements were controlled by circuits and programmed in C on a
  Raspberry Pi. A motor and a connected optical encoder allowed for the control
  of the puppet's limbs, such as moving each limb up/down by a certain distance.
</p>

<h1>What We did</h1>
<p>
  Though the lab instructors had designed both the hardware and software, my
  lab partner and I were responsible for the construction, testing, and
  troubleshooting of the puppet. We had to read schematics, build and test the
  circuits, modify code to control the puppet's movements, and
  integrate the hardware and software.
</p>

<p>
  I focused mainly on the software side of the project and worked together with
  my partner on other areas on the projects, particularly the troubleshooting
  and testing aspects.
