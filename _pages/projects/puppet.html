<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  As a part of my junior year electrical and computer engineering labs,
  I worked with a lab partner to implement a marionette puppet that performed
  a dance routine on command.
</p>

<h1>How the Puppet Worked</h1>
<p>
  The puppet's movements were controlled by circuits and programmed in C on a
  Raspberry Pi. A motor with a connected optical encoder allowed us to control
  the puppet's limbs, which included moving each limb up or down by a set amount.
</p>

<h1>What We Did</h1>
<p>
  Though the lab instructors had designed both the hardware and software, my
  lab partner and I were responsible for the construction, testing, and
  troubleshooting of the puppet. We had to read schematics, build and test the
  circuits, solder a printed circuit board (PCB), modify code to control the puppet's movements, and
  integrate the hardware and software.
</p>

<p>
  I focused mainly on the software side of the project and worked together with
  my partner on other areas on the projects, including the troubleshooting
  and testing aspects.
