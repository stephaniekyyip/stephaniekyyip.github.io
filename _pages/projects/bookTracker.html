  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>
    <a href = "https://still-scrubland-90743.herokuapp.com/" target = "_blank">Book Tracker</a>
    is a web app I created as a replacement to the spreadsheet I have
    been using to record all the books I have read since 2008. I wanted to create something with
    a clean and easy-to-use user interface that would allow me to not only record the
    books I have read, but also analyze my reading habits across the past decade.
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides creating and modifying book entries, users can also search and sort their
    list of books. Other features include the ability to upload a CSV file to add
    multiple book entries at once and an analytics page with data visualization and statistics
    of the user's reading habits.
  </p>
  
  <h1>How the App Works</h1>
  <p>
    I used a tech stack consisting of PHP
    and MySQL on the back end, and jQuery on the front end with C3.js/ D3.js
    for data visualization. The live version of the app is hosted on Heroku.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since this was my first web app, I chose to use technology I had used before,
    including Apache and PHP. I decided not to use any web frameworks or libraries,
    such as React or Laravel, in order to understand the basics, though I quickly understood
    why such technologies can be helpful. This project was a learning experience that
    allowed me to dip my toes into web development.
