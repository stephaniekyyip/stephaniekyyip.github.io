  <h1>Snapshots From Seattle</h1>
  <p>
    I have been an avid photographer since taking a high school photography class.
    During college, I enjoyed wandering Seattle with
    my camera in tow and taking pictures of whatever caught my eye. I fell
    in love with the Pacific Northwest through photography.
