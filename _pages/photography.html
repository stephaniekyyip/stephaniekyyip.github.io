  <h1>Snapshots From Seattle</h1>
  <p>
    I've been interested in photography since taking a high school photography class.
    During college, I wandered Seattle with
    my camera in tow and taking pictures of whatever caught my eye. I took over
    8,000 photos in those four years. Here are a few from that collection.
