       <h3>Overview</h3>
       <p>As a part of my year-long senior project, I worked in an
         interdisciplinary team comprised of environmental science
         and electrical/ computer engineering students. Our sponsor,
         Glacier Peak Institute, tasked us with creating
         an environmental sensor curriculum for middle school students in Darrington, WA.
         The requirements were that the curriculum had to be low-cost,
         fun and interesting for the kids, and involve the
         outdoors. We decided to create an electronic rain gauge curriculum
         due to the high levels of rainfall in Darrington and our faculty
         advisor's prior experience in constructing a rain gauge.
       </p>

       <h3>How the Rain Gauge Works</h3>
       <p>The physical design of the rain gauge involved a funnel attached to a PVC pipe
         that allowed water to be collected in the PVC. At the bottom of the
         PVC pipe was a pressure sensor used to find the pressure of the
         rainwater, which was encased in a waterproofed container. Wires
         from the pressure sensor were threaded through a waterproof box
         to connect to the breadboard inside that contains the rest of the
         electronic components. The second pressure sensor on the breadboard
         is used to find the atmospheric pressure.</p>
        <p>The two pressure sensors are used to find a differential pressure,
          which can be used to to find the depth of rainwater collected in a
          PVC tube after calibration. This pressure measurement, along with
          the current time measured by the Real Time Clock (RTC), was logged
          onto a micro SD card at a set interval of 15 minutes. The idea is
          that the rain gauge can be set outside to automatically collect
          rain data with minimal maintenance, which includes retrieving the
          SD card to collect the data and changing the batteries.</p>

       <h3>My Role within the Project</h3>
       <p>I interfaced various electronic components with the
         microcontroller using SPI and I2C and
         wrote Arduino code to control the components.
         I worked on the construction of the rain gauge and designed the
         waterproof housing for the pressure sensors. Additionally, I played a
         leadership role in the project by organizing meetings and
         communicating with the facuty advisors and project sponsor on behalf of the team.</p>
